#Portfolio Optimizer

A comprehensive Python implementation of Modern Portfolio Theory (Markowitz model) with Monte Carlo simulation for optimal asset allocation. This tool helps investors maximize returns for a given level of risk by calculating the efficient frontier and identifying portfolios with the highest Sharpe ratio.

##Features

Historical Data Retrieval: Automatically fetches stock price data from Yahoo Finance
Risk-Return Analysis: Calculates annualized returns, volatility, and covariance matrices
Monte Carlo Simulation: Generates thousands of random portfolios to map the efficient frontier
Portfolio Optimization: Finds optimal asset allocation using Sharpe ratio maximization or variance minimization
Visualization: Creates informative charts including:

- Price evolution charts
- Covariance matrix heatmaps
- Efficient frontier plots
- Optimal allocation pie charts
- Statistical Reporting: Provides detailed performance metrics and optimization results
